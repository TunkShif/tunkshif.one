> So far we've only talked about morphological structures in a static sense. We say words 'have' affixes and are 'consist of' morphemes. However, it is often more convenient to describe a complex word as an outcome of a process. For example, we can say that affixes are attached to the base or complex words can be derived[^1] from simpler ones. Thus, we need an approach to formally describe these processes.

In this article, we will first explore various morphological patterns from different languages before introducing two approaches for describing morphological rules.

## Morphological Patterns

We have seen examples in English like $$\small cat-cats,\ book-books$$. In English, one way to form the plural of a noun is by adding a $$\small \textit{-s}$$ suffix. So it is clear that $$\small \textit{cat-s}$$ consists of two morphemes.

However, consider the following examples in German:

$$
\small
\begin{array}{ll}
  \text{singular} & \text{plural} \\
  Mutter & Mütter \\
  Tochter & Töchter \\
  Vater & Väter
\end{array}
$$

One way to form plurals in German is by changing the vowel in the stem, where the plural forms cannot be segmented into two morphemes. In cases like this, it is more intuitive to think of something has changed rather than something has been added.

Then, a morpheme is just a special subtype of morphological patterns.

Linguists often distinguish two basic types of morphological patterns:

- **concatenative**: when two morphemes are ordered one after another
- **non-concatenative**: everything else except concatenative ones

[^1]: We have talked about derivation in morphological relationships. It is a relationship between lexemes of a word family. But it is also commonly used in inflectional morphology. So we can say that $$\small gets$$ is derived from $$\small get$$.
