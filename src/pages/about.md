Here is a fully detailed self-introduction and it's generally about what I like and how my hobbies influenced my choice of life. It'll be very long because I want to cover as much about myself as possible. I always get amazed when I find some random strangers on the Internet share much interest with me, and it's just like a kind of subtle connection. So hopefully you'll also feel the same way when reading through this.

I came from a not-very-big city in China. Computer and the Internet have been accessible to me since an early age, thanks to my quite open-minded parents. Then for me, the Internet has become a window to know the outer world and to learn many new things.

Though initially, I would just play video games on the computer all the time, then suddenly a game deeply attracted me and I can say that it almost changed my life. It is Minecraft, the game that has become so popular all around the world nowadays. In the beginning, I would just play it on my own, after some time playing, I started to be active in some game communities in Tieba (you can think of it as the Chinese version of Reddit), learning and sharing fun stuff about the game. There're so many things you can do about the game. You can not only build what you want in the game, but also you can change the game to be what you want.

I've made lots of friends through the game community, and I didn't want to just be playing the game, I wanted to make something about the game. Then I started creating my own texture pack and learning doing pixel arts. I'd say that, though I do think I have a good aesthetic taste, I'm literally not quite good at creating arts. But anyway, it's such a fun experience. (BTW, I was using Paint.NET for this at that time, and I still think it is the most easy-to-use yet quite powerful image editing tool.)

Vanilla Minecraft can get boring after a long time of playing, so I started getting into modded Minecraft. It's still the same game, but a whole new world. Minecraft the game itself just became a platform or a game engine with modding, and thousands of community-created mods have made the game with infinite possibilities. I began to do localization work on them, bringing those cool mods to Chinese communities. Since lots of those mods are open-sourced projects, I can easily make contributions to them. That's also the first time I come to know the concept of open source, and now I'm still an open-source enthusiast. This is the time when my English improved so much, I just learned so much more from the game than in school. Also, learning languages as well as studying linguistics has become another hobby of mine, but that's another story to tell.

Then finally, I wanted to create my own mod. So I started to learn programming and many other things about the computer. That's why now I'm at university studying software engineering. Though it's kind of a shame that I've never accomplished to make a Minecraft mod until now.

I've mentioned that I love learning languages. Currently, I'm focusing on learning Spanish, and I hope that I can finally be a polyglot. Besides this, music is also important for me, and most of the time, it is music that motivates me to learn a new language or even a new culture. I'll list a few of my favorite singers/musicians in the following paragraphs. I know it may sound silly, but personally, I like to see if someone has the same taste of music as mine (lol).

  <summary>music info</summary>

I'll talk about the music outside the English world for now.

First, for Spanish-speaking singers: [Pablo Alborán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Albor%C3%A1n), [Pablo López](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_L%C3%B3pez_(singer)), [Juanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanes), [David Bisbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bisbal), [Ricky Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Martin), [Shakira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakira), [J Balvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Balvin), [Maluma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluma), [Rosalía](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosal%C3%ADa_(singer)) *y más*...

For Greek singers (here I'd like to use Latin transcription rather than Greek letters for the names): [STAN Antipariotis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(singer)), [Konstantinos Argyros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantinos_Argyros), [Nikiforos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikiforos), [Giorgos Livanis](https://www.instagram.com/giorgos_livanis/?hl=en), [Stelios Legakis](https://www.instagram.com/stelioslegakisofficial/?hl=en) ...

And I'm also interested in Arabic music: [Tamer Hosny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamer_Hosny), [Joseph Attieh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Attieh) ...

From all the above you can see that I'm a huge fan of Latin, Middle Eastern, and Balkan music.

Recently, I've been into Russian music from like: [JONY](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q70351735), [Jah Khalib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jah_Khalib), [Emin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin_Agalarov), [Sergey Lazarev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Lazarev) ...

Besides all that worldwide music, I can almost find some of my favorite singers/musicians in all kinds of genres, including mainstream pop music from [Lana Del Rey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Del_Rey), [Katy Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry), [Beyoncé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9), [Rihanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna) (although not a singer anymore), [Lady Gaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga), [The Weeknd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd), [Billie Eilish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Eilish), [Dua Lipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua_Lipa), [Ariana Grande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande) and so much more that I can't list them all.

Also, I'm into indie/alternative/advant/experimental or whatever music. I love [Björk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rk), [Tori Amos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_Amos), [Kate Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bush), [Arca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arca_(musician)) and more...

There's so much more that I can talk about, maybe I'll write more about myself when feeling in the mood.
