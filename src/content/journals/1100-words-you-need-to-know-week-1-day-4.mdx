## Day 4

> It is difficult to change someone's opinion by **badgering** him. The child who begs his mother to "get off his back" when she **implores** him for some assistance with the household **drudgery**, may very well plead **interminably** for some special privilege when he wants something for himself. How paradoxical that neither is able to **perceive** that no one likes being nagged.

### badger

- to bother, annoy persistently

除了作动词的含义以外，这个词还是下面这种动物的名字，獾（huān）

![badger](../../assets/images/journals/1100-words-you-need-to-know-week-1-day-4/badger.png)

但这两个词义的词源并不相同，之间应该没有联系

### implore

- to plead urgently for aid or mercy

表示为很紧急的帮助恳求，这个词的词源挺有意思的，来自于in- + _plorare_，在拉丁语里是哭的意思。

### drudgery

- boring, dull, or hard work

指很单调乏味但又不得不干的活儿，例如打扫房间、洗衣服等等

drudge: 做苦工的人

### interminable

- unending, endless

由 terminate 派生得来

### perceive

- to understand, know, become aware of
