## Day 3

> How **paradoxical** that the world's greatest chefs have all been men! Cooking would clearly seem to be a field that lies exclusively within women's **realm**, yet the **annals** of cookery are replete with masculine names: Brillat Savarin, Ritz, Diat, Larousse. To **compound** the puzzle, there has rarely been a **tinge** of rumor or scandal casting doubts on the masculinity of these heroes of cuisine.

### paradox

- a statement which involves two or more facts that contradict each other

### realm

- a general area of knowledge, activity, or interest

- (literary) a country ruled by a king or queue

### annals

- historical records

很明显这个词跟 annual 是同源的，表示一年又一年产生的记录，现在就指历史上的记录，或者用在学术领域作*年鉴*的意思，例如*医学年鉴*

要注意必须以复数形式出现，而且不要漏看或漏写了一个 n...

### compound

- to make a difficult situation worse by adding more problems

作为专有名词出现的时候都很熟悉啦，在化学上有*化合物*的意思，在语言学上有*复合词*的意思。但作为动词的时候是*增加、加剧*的意思，特别指让不好的情况变得更坏

### tinge

- a slight amount of a color, emotion, or quality

表示*一点点、一丝丝*，用来形容颜色、情感或品质

最初只是动词*染上淡淡的颜色*的意思 (late 15c., "to dye, color slightly")，来自于拉丁语 _tingere_ "to dye, color"
