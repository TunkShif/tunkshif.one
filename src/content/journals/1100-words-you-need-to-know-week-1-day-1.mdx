## Day 1

> The youngster who reads **voraciously**, though **indiscriminately**, does not necessarily gain in wisdom over the teenager who is more selective in his reading choices. A young man who has read the life story of every **eminent** athlete of the twentieth century, or a coed who has **steeped** herself in every social-protest novel she can get her hands on, may very well be learning all there is to know in a very limited area. But books are **replete** with so many wonders that it is often discouraging to see bright young people limit their own experiences.

### voracious

- craving for great quantities of food

- having an extremely strong desire to have a lot of something

同音词 _veracious_: truthful, honest

### indiscrimanate

- something discriminate makes no fine distinctions _不加区分的_

派生自 discriminate _区分；辨别_，源自拉丁语 discriminare，本义也是*分辨*，但现在这个词的词义更多地变成了*歧视*

### eminent

- highly regarded, respected

由 _ex- + -minere_ 构成，这词根竟然跟 amount, dismount, mountain, mouth 是同源的。

_prominent_: important, noticable

_imminent_: just about to happen

### steep

- get somthing drenched or soaked in liquid

除了常见的*陡峭的*含义还有*浸泡*的意思。当然我们俗语里讲的“试一下水”在英语里的说法也很类似，也是用 steep 这个词。

### replete

- full

就是充满了的意思，来自于拉丁语 replere，词根来自于原始印欧语 _\*pele- (1)_，英语的 fill 也跟这个同源，如果了解[格林定律](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A0%BC%E6%9E%97%E5%AE%9A%E5%BE%8B)的话很容易说得通。
