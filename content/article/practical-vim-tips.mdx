# Vim Tips

## Number Increment and Decrement

Pressing <kbd>C-a</kbd> or <kbd>C-x</kbd> to increse or decrease a number by 1. If the current cursor is not a number, it will find the first number of the current line.

## Multiline Operation

Press <kbd>C-v</kbd> to enter Visual-Block mode, then select target lines, then do operation on one line. For insert, use <kbd>I</kbd> to enter insert mode.

## Make Correction in Insert Mode

| Keystrokes     | Effect                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| <kbd>C-h</kbd> | delete back one character |
| <kbd>C-w</kbd> | delete back one word      |
| <kbd>C-u</kbd> | delete back one line      |

## Go back to Normal Mode in Insert Mode

| Keystrokes     | Effecct                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | switch to normal mode        |
| <kbd>C-[</kbd> | switch to normal mode        |
| <kbd>C-o</kbd> | switch to insert-normal mode |

In insert-normal mode, we can excute a single command then switch to insert mode immediately.

## Paste from a Register without Leaving Insert Mode

Pressing <kbd>C-r \{register\}</kbd> in insert mode.

Pressing <kbd>C-r C-p \{register\}</kbd> to insert text literally and fix any unintended indentation.

## Evaluate an Expression from Register

Pressing <kbd>C-r=\{expression\}</kbd> to evaluate an expression and paste it directly without leaving insert mode.

## Insert Character From ASCII Code or Unicode

From insert mode, type <kbd>C-v\{code\}</kbd> with a three-digit number to insert a character.

For example, `A` can be inserted with <kbd>C-v065</kbd>.

Unicode characters can be inserted using a four-digit hexademical code.

For example, `¿` can be inserted with <kbd>C-vu00bf</kbd>.

Besides, we can insert character literal by using <kbd>C-v\{char\}</kbd>.

For example, we can insert a tab with <kbd>C-v&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd>.

## Insert Digraph in Insert Mode

`æ` can be inserted using <kbd>C-vae</kbd>, and `¿` can be inserted using <kbd>C-v?I</kbd>.

## Overwriting Text with Replace Mode

Press `R` to enter replace mode, then the following typed characters will overwrite existing text.

A tab character is visually of multi-character length, but it represents a single character. And replace mode treats a tab as s single character.

In virtual replace mode, triggered by pressing <kbd>gR</kbd>, a tab chracter is treated as multuple characters as in `tabstop` setting.

Use `r{char}` or `gr{char}` to apply a single replacement.

## Selecting with Visual Mode

There're three visual mode variants, character-wise, line-wise and block-wise visual mode, triggered by <kbd>v</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd> <kbd>C-v</kbd> respectively.

In visual mode, one end of the selected text is fixed, and the other moves freely with our cursor. We can use <kbd>o</kbd> to go to the other end of selected text.

Press <kbd>gv</kbd> to reselected the last visual selection.
